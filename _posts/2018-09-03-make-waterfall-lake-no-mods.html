<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always dreamed of building a waterfall in Cities: Skylines but didn’t know how? Well, me too! But then I found out about the Fresh Water Outlet. It’s a service building that arrived in the Natural Disasters expansion.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/waterfall-no-mods.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-850" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/waterfall-no-mods.jpg" alt="Making a waterfall with Natural Disasters water outlet" width="900" height="506" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Outlet pumps water when there’s excess water production. It’ll shut off automatically if your city’s water demand grows so much that there's none to spare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t bought Natural Disasters because as undeniably epic as the disasters are, they aren’t really my thing. But… I wanted helicopters. You can toggle off random disasters and just enjoy the new buildings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admittedly some mods make building waterfalls and rivers a bit easier, but it’s more than possible in the vanilla game, too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a spot of the outlet</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bore-hole.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-487 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/bore-hole.jpg" alt="Making a bore hole" width="1920" height="1080" /></a></p>
<p><em>Digging the bore hole.</em></p>
<p>I'm using the<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eden Valley map from the Green Cities expansion. It’s got some great accessible hill areas crying out for nature reserves, but you can also build a hill yourself if you’re on a flat map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do is work out where your water will spring from. Once that’s done, use the Shift terrain landscaping tool to bore a hole in the ground. When it’s deep enough, use the Slope terrain to even it out a bit. That’ll help with placement, but also give you a chance to make a little hilltop lake.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903135714_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-482 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/20180903135714_1.jpg" alt="Even out the bore hole" width="1920" height="1080" /></a></p>
<p><em>Even the hole out if you like. You'll be able to turn it into a hilltop lake. If not, just leave as a wellspring.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you’ll probably need to fiddle about a bit with the placement. Try rotating the building to find the perfect spot. We’re aiming to get it sat as low as possible so that the water sits over the top of it.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/09/water-outlet-waterfall.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-483 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/water-outlet-waterfall.jpg" alt="Filling the bore hole" width="1920" height="1080" /></a><br />
<em>Connect the Outlet up to water and power.</em></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a notch and small lake</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/09/create-waterfall.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-481 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/create-waterfall.jpg" alt="Round out the bowl" width="1920" height="1080" /></a></p>
<p><em>Create the notch where your little lake will spill out from.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, make a notch where you want the water to leave. Later, you can lift this area up a bit if the Outlet isn’t fully submerged. Connect it with water pipes and bring over some electricity. Once the water’s flowing, find out where it’s going and use the terrain tools to shape it however you want.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/09/check-water-flow.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-480 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/check-water-flow.jpg" alt="Checking the flow for the waterfall" width="1920" height="1080" /></a></p>
<p><em>Keep using terrain tools liberally to shape your new waterway.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovecitiesskylines.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/09/submerged-water-outlet.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-479 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/E:\Wordpressimporter\LCS/2018/09/submerged-water-outlet.jpg" alt="Submerging the water outlet" width="1920" height="1080" /></a></p>
<p><em>Change the shape of the pond until you've got the Outlet as submerged as you want.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use the same trick to make a lake or pond, but unless you constantly turn your outlet on and off, it’ll overflow. So in the vanilla game, it’s better to make sure you run the water out to a river or sea. The one exception is if you use a Water Pumping Station at the bottom. Its capacity is much higher than the outlet, so it'll just suck all that water back up.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover up the machinery and admire your waterfall</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re ready, there’s some hiding of electricity pylons to be done. You can mask them with trees, or maybe use your nature reserve’s buildings to bring power down to the water. That would give it a great finished look and act as a starting point for your trails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there you go! Thanks for reading.</span></p>
